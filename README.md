# 4-bit-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-ALU-Design-and-Simulation
Designed and simulated a custom transistor-level 4-bit ALU in LTSpice, supporting 8 operations (Addition, Subtraction, Arithmetic Shift Right, Rotate Shift Left, Rotate Shift Right, OR, XOR, NAND) with decoder-based operation selection and multiplexer logic for output.
